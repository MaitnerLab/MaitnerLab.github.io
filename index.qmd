# Overview
The focus of the lab is (primarily) on topics related to biodiversity, including understanding the drivers of biodiversity patterns and how biodiversity may be impacted by global changes, and working on making these findings relevant for decision makers.  Work in the lab is open to any group of organisms, but tends to focus on plants (as these account for most of the biomass on Earth and their traits are primary drivers of terrestrial ecosystem functioning).

# Research Projects
- Global Change and Conservation
- Macroecology
- Open Science


# Join the lab!
I'm currently looking for Masters students to join the lab. Students should be strongly self-motivated and full of ideas they're interested in! I'm particularly interested in students that have an interest in either (or both) of the following approaches: 1) using data wrangling and coding to address large-scale questions, or 2) using field-based methods to address ecological or global-change questions.

Email me or something?
